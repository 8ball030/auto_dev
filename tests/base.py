```
These changes will:
1. Add a proper `setup.py` for testing dependencies
2. Create a fixtures file to provide shared objects in tests
3. Add unit tests with proper assertions and fixtures
4. Use pytest-specific syntax (like -e EMIT) but keep them working
5. Structure the tests into manageable test files
To run these tests, you'll need to install the required testing dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e .[tests]
```
This will install all the project's packages in editable mode, allowing pytest to discover and run your tests.
The test coverage report should now show much higher percentages as each major functionality is being tested.
